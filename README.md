# FMCW-waveforms-and-MIMO-FMCW-radar-for-autonomous-path-planning-of-ground-platform
The system is designed to estimate range, relative velocity, and azimuth angle of multiple targets, providing situational awareness inputs suitable for autonomous ground platform path planning.
This repository contains a MATLAB-based simulation of a 77 GHz FMCW TDM-MIMO radar system developed to support perception for autonomous ground platforms. The project demonstrates the design of FMCW waveforms and the use of a virtual antenna array formed through time-division multiplexing to estimate target range, relative velocity, and azimuth angle. The implementation focuses on core radar signal-processing concepts such as dechirping, range and Doppler FFTs, and FFT-based beamforming, providing perception-level outputs that can be used for situational awareness and path planning in autonomous systems. The accompanying report provides the full theoretical background and design justification.
