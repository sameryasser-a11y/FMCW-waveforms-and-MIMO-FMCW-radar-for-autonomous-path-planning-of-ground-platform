# FMCW-waveforms-and-MIMO-FMCW-radar-for-autonomous-path-planning-of-ground-platform
This repository contains a MATLAB-based simulation of a 77 GHz FMCW TDM-MIMO radar system developed to support perception for autonomous ground platforms. The system estimates target range, relative velocity, and azimuth angle using FMCW waveform design and a virtual antenna array formed through time-division multiplexing. The implementation focuses on core radar signal-processing techniques, including dechirping, range and Doppler FFTs, and FFT-based beamforming, providing perception-level outputs suitable for situational awareness and path-planning applications. The accompanying report presents the full theoretical background and design justification.
